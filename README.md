# Criollo

A powerful Cocoa based web application framework for OS X and iOS.

Criollo helps create self-contained web applications that deliver content directly over HTTP or behind a web server (through FastCGI) - all the while leveraging the technologies you know and love: GCD, NSURLSession, CoreImage etc.
