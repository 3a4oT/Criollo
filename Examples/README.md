# Examples

Here’s a list of the examples to help you get started.

## Hello World

[https://github.com/thecatalinstan/Criollo/tree/master/Examples/HelloWorld](https://github.com/thecatalinstan/Criollo/tree/master/Examples/HelloWorld). 

This example contains the full code of the “Hello World” app developed in the [“Getting Started” guide](https://github.com/thecatalinstan/Criollo/wiki/Getting-Started).

## HelloWorld-ObjC and HelloWorld-Swift

[https://github.com/thecatalinstan/Criollo/tree/master/Examples/HelloWorld-ObjC](https://github.com/thecatalinstan/Criollo/tree/master/Examples/HelloWorld-ObjC) and [https://github.com/thecatalinstan/Criollo/tree/master/Examples/HelloWorld-Swift](https://github.com/thecatalinstan/Criollo/tree/master/Examples/HelloWorld-Swift). 

These are two standalone `launchd` daemons. The same exact functionality is replicated in Objective-C and Swift.

## HelloWorld-MultiTarget

[https://github.com/thecatalinstan/Criollo/tree/master/Examples/HelloWorld-MultiTarget](https://github.com/thecatalinstan/Criollo/tree/master/Examples/HelloWorld-MultiTarget).

This example creates a `launchd` daemon app, an iOS app and an OS X Cocoa app, using a shared code-base. The code structure in this one is a little more complicated, as it needs to reuse the same code base for different targets.

You should have previous knowledge of creating multi-platform projects to make understanding this example easier.
